Title: Resultant, Subresultants, and GCD of Two Multivariate Polynomials

Description: Resultant, subresultants, greatest common divisor, integral 
    division (aka division without remainder) of two multivariate polynomials 
    with rational coefficients, Sturm-Habicht sequence and square-free 
    factorization of a multivariate polynomial with rational coefficients. 
    The computations are performed by the 'C++' library 'CGAL' 
    (<https://www.cgal.org/>). Resultants have applications in polynomial 
    systems solving, number theory, and algebraic geometry. The package
    also contains some functions computing the number of real roots of a
    univariate polynomial with rational coefficients, and a function computing
    the division with remainder of two univariate polynomials with rational 
    coefficients.
