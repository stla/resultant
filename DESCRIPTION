Description: Computation of the resultant, the subresultants, the greatest 
    common divisor, and the integral division (aka division without remainder) 
    of two multivariate polynomials with rational coefficients. These 
    computations are performed by the 'C++' library 'CGAL' 
    (<https://www.cgal.org/>). Resultants have applications in polynomial
    systems solving, number theory, and algebraic geometry. The package
    also contains a function computing the number of real roots of a
    univariate polynomial with rational coefficients, and a function computing
    the division with remainder of two univariate polynomials with rational 
    coefficients.
