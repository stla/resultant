Description: Computation of the resultant, the subresultants, and the
    greatest common divisor of two multivariate polynomials with rational
    coefficients, performed by the 'C++' library 'CGAL'
    (<https://www.cgal.org/>). Resultants have applications in polynomial
    systems solving, number theory, and algebraic geometry. The package
    also contains a function computing the number of real roots of a
    univariate polynomial with rational coefficients.
